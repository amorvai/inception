# This is the user that NGINX (alpine based) will run as.
# It is a good practice to run web servers with a non-privileged user for security reasons.
# The user should have read access to the files served by NGINX.
# If you want to run NGINX as a different user, change this line accordingly.
# The user directive is optional. If not specified, NGINX will run as the user that started it.
# Running NGINX as root (default) is not recommended for security reasons.
# If you change the user, make sure to adjust the permissions of the files and directories
# that NGINX needs to access.
